    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "- Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset\n",

    "- Each observation consists of the date along with the opening price, closing price, high price, low price, adjusted closing price, and volume traded on that day.\n",

    "We will also want to look at, over a given set of observations. see how the opening and closing prices change. Looking at if they go up consistently over time to imply a good return.\n",
    "- The dataset is already relatively clean. The one thing we may want to do is normalize the prices, so we can look at the volatility and returns in terms of percent change easier between stocks.\n",
    "We will likely want to adjust the names of the stocks from their tickers to the official names for readability.\n",
    "If you don't yet know what your dataset(s) will be, you should describe what you desire in terms of the above bullets.\n",
    "2. \n",
    "- Another dataset we may want would be similar historical data but with multiple observations per day. This would be more useful in analyzing volatility on a shorter term basis.\n",
    "- This would contain the same variables with more observations as it would contain multiple observations per day.\n",
    "- This would also allow us to look at more interesting volatility metrics other than just daily highs and lows. like average price change per hour(or per however often the intra-day observations take place)\n",
    "3. \n",
    "- A dataset that could be useful for non-analysis purposes would be a list of each stock and etf on the nasdaq exchange with its ticker name and its official name.\n",
    "- this would consist of 2 variables and 8049 observations (one for each stock/etf)\n",
    "- The variables would simply be the ticker name and official name for each stock/etf\n",

    "One of the main ethical issues that we believe is present is a strong bias towards American markets. Since we only have data from the NASDAQ exchange, any beneficial information or model we make may not be very effective in foreign markets. This could lead to an unfair benefit towards people who invest in American markets versus those who don't or can't. This could be mitigated by finding datasets that include information from multiple markets other than the NASDAQ. We could also just test a few other markets and see if the conclusions we find in the American markets carry over to those ones. If so, we can possibly show that the benefit of any model developed would carry over to other markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential issue is the unfairness of those who have the technology to run whatever model we develop versus those who don't. While the world has seen a great increase in access to technology. There are still great differences in the quality of the technology people can access. Seeing as the models we will develop will run based off of large datasets and may get quite complex. It is possible that our model would be more beneficial to those who can run similar simulations quicker on better technology. This could create an unfair financial advantage to those who are more likely to already be financially better off, based on the fact that they have access to better technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential issue is if the model is effective enough in predicting and managing stocks. It could lead to a loss in jobs of those who work in the financial sector. A way to mitigate both this issue and the previously addressed issue would be to restrict the use of our model to research purposes. therefore preventing any market advantages from being gained by those who would unfairly benefit from the model.\n",
